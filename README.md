 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

 Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The project focuses on handling highly imbalanced data and improving fraud detection performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

  Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Transactions: 284,807
- Fraud cases: Highly imbalanced
- Target column: Class (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)

  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SMOTE (imbalanced-learn)

  Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Random Forest (Final Model)

   Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
3. Train-test split
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Performance comparison

  Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

 Conclusion
Random Forest combined with SMOTE achieved the best performance, significantly improving fraud detection recall. This project demonstrates the importance of handling imbalanced data in real-world financial applications.
